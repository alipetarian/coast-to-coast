        on a yacht, but we know how to install the perfect refrigeration system for
        your vessel. We strongly value that moment, at the end of a sunny sailing
        day, when you want nothing more than to have a cold drink on your boat.

        For us, an installation process means to choose the perfect refrigeration
        system for your boat. Also, if together we conclude it is not us that should
        do the installation, we are satisfied we could help you with the right advice!
        <br />
        <br />
        We can set up a refrigeration system from the ground-up for your boat.
        Adding a refrigeration on your vessel is not like going to a store, buy
        one and connect it to a source of power. You need to consider at least the
        following factors:
        <ul>
          <li>
            What type of power you have on board and how much battery the system will need,
          </li>
          <li>
            What space you have on the boat,
          </li>
          <li>
            Where to install the compressor,
          </li>
          <li>
            what kind of refrigeration box you need – think of size, colors
            and finishes, and location.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Call us and let’s search for the perfect refrigeration for your boat!
