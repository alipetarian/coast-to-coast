excerpt: In January 2019, Raymond Barnes established Coast 2 Coast Refrigeration
  with a view to being able to service San Diego Bay area customer base, from
  the simplest refrigeration or A/C system, and to include not only business but
  the boating world as well. Coast 2 Coastâ€™s philosophy is about ensuring the
  solution you get is tailored to suit the size, space and need you may have.
  Raymond has made sure to include all insurances, bonds, and other licenses,
  and can provide upon request.
