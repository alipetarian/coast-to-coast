## Call a professional!

The best time to get an air conditioning unit inspected by a licensed professional is before the heat arrives.

It will save you money in the long run by making sure your unit is working as intended which saves money on your monthly bill. A professional will also catch any major problems before they damage your AC unit and result in an additional cost to repair or replace.
